## TypeScript

### Generics

#### Problem

Let's say we have a function that takes a callback function and call it. 

Here's our function:

```ts
const mainFn = (cb) => cb()
```

And the functions that get passed to it are:

```ts
// One that returns a number
mainFn(
  () => 5
)

// One that returns a string
mainFn(
  () => 'string'
)

// Another than returns an array
mainFn(
  () => [...] // Array that contain numbers
)
```

Our function `mainFn` can handle these easily, but an issue arose. We're using TypeScript, so we have to define the type of `cb` and `mainFn` return type.

Easiest solution is to hardcode the types:

```ts
const mainFn = (cb: (() => number) | (() => string) | (() => number[])): number | string | number[] => cb()
```

Now let's say `mainFn` will be called 100 times, with 100 different function functions, and each function has a different return type. Hardcoding a 100 type is overkill.

Wouldn't it be amazing to have a feature that makes it possible to pass the return type the moment we call the function? Here comes the `Generics` to help!

#### Solution

To fix that issue, we can define `mainFn` like this:

```ts
const mainFn = <T>(cb: () => T): T => cb()
```

The syntax of Generics is `<>`. Which works similar to parameters, but instead is a placeholder for types. `T` is the name we have given to the first placeholder slot. It could be `<ReturnType>` or `<PotatoWalkingDownTheRoad`.

Compared with parameters:

```ts
// Parameter syntax
// Wraps its placeholders with parenthesis
(num1, num2) => num1 + num2

// Generics syntax
// Wraps its placeholders with angle brackets 
// and comes before the parameters
<T1, T2>(num1: T1, num2: T2) => num1 + num2
```

Back to our *main* issue, we can solve it by passing the type everytime we call `mainFn`:

```ts
// One that returns a number
// We define the return type as number through generics
mainFn<number>(
  () => 5
)

// One that returns a string
// We define the return type as string through generics
mainFn<string>(
  () => 'string'
)

// Another than returns an array 
// We define the return type as number[] through generics
mainFn<number[]>(
  () => [...] // Array that contain numbers
)
```
