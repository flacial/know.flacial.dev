# Stacks & Queues

Stacks and queues are linear data structures that allow us to access data sequentially. They are built on top of lower-level data structures such as arrays or linked lists, and they provide fewer methods than the data structures they are built upon.

### Stacks

Stacks follow the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle, in which the last element added is the first one to be removed. They are useful when we only care about the value we last added, such as in the history of a web browser or the call stack of a programming language. Stacks can be implemented using either arrays or linked lists.

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value
    this.next = null
  }
}

class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.top = null
    this.bottom = null
    this.length = 0
  }
  peek() {
    return this.top
  }
  push(value) {
    this.length += 1

    if (!this.top) {
      const top = new Node(value)
      this.top = top
      this.bottom = top
      return this.top
    }

    const oldTop = this.top
    const newTop = new Node(value)
    newTop.next = oldTop

    this.top = newTop

    return this
  }
  pop() {
    if (!this.top) return null

    if (this.length === 0 && this.bottom) {
      this.bottom = null
    }

    this.top = this.top.next
    this.length -= 1

    return this
  }
  isEmpty() {
    return !this.length
  }
}

const myStack = new Stack()
```

### Queues

They are the opposite of Stacks, we access FIFO, the first element in the queue gets accessed first.

- Push is named Enqueue
- Pop is named Dequeue
- Peek shows the first element in the queue

Queues follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, in which the first element added is the first one to be removed. They are implemented using linked lists because it is efficient to add and remove elements from the beginning of a linked list. Using arrays for queues can result in slower performance due to the overhead of re-indexing the array when elements are removed.

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value
    this.next = null
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = null
    this.last = null
    this.length = 0
  }
  peek() {
    return this.first
  }
  enqueue(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value)
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.first = newNode
      this.last = newNode
    } else {
      this.last.next = newNode
      this.last = newNode
    }
    this.length++
    return this
  }
  dequeue() {
    if (!this.first) {
      return null
    }
    if (this.first === this.last) {
      this.last = null
    }
    const holdingPointer = this.first
    this.first = this.first.next
    this.length--
    return this
  }
  //isEmpty;
}
```

### Pros

- Fast Operations â€” O(1)
- Fast Peek
- Ordered

### Cons

- Slow Lookup
