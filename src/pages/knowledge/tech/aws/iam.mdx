# AWS IAM

## AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

AWS IAM is a service that enables you to manage access to AWS resources. IAM enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. In this document, we'll discuss the major components and concepts of IAM and how they work together to help you manage access to your resources.

### Principal

A principal is an entity that tries to perform an action on an AWS resource. Principals can be AWS accounts, IAM roles, IAM users, or federated SAML users.

### Authentication

Authentication is the process of confirming the identity of the principal trying to access AWS resources. IAM uses AWS credentials, such as an AWS access key ID and secret access key, to verify the identity of the principal.

### Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining what actions the authenticated principal can perform on a given AWS resource. This determination is based on the policies that are associated with the principal.

### Actions

Actions are the operations that can be performed on AWS resources. IAM policies define which actions a principal is allowed to perform.

For example, a policy might allow a principal to create an Amazon S3 bucket or delete an Amazon S3 object.

### Resources

Resources are the AWS resources that can be acted upon. A resource can be a specific Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon EC2 instance, or an Amazon SNS topic, for example.

## Components of IAM

### Users

Users are AWS entities that represent people or applications that interact with AWS. Each user in your AWS account has a unique AWS access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests to AWS.

### Groups

Groups are collections of IAM users. You can use groups to manage the policies for multiple users at once. For example, you might create a group for testers and a group for engineers, and assign different policies to each group.

### Roles

A role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. Roles can be assigned to AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, or to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users in your account.

For example, you might create a role that allows an EC2 instance to access an Amazon S3 bucket, or you might create a role that allows an IAM user to assume the role of an administrator by elevating their permissions.

### Policies

Policies are JSON objects that define the rights of an entity or resource when associated with it. Policies are created and linked to IAM entities, such as users, groups, or roles. The policy's permissions determine whether a request should be approved or rejected.

## Advanced Usage

IAM can be used for advanced scenarios, such as enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing AWS resources. For example, you could create a policy that requires an MFA token to be provided before a user is allowed to access an Amazon S3 bucket. This could be achieved using [conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) when creating the policy for a role:

```json
{
  "Id": "Policy1676027581647",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1676027579972",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3::{ID}",
      "Condition": {
        "BoolIfExists": {
          "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"
        }
      },
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
