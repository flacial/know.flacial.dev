# AWS â€” EC2

EC2 helps engineers create a customizable server in which they can customize its OS, resources, and firewall.

## Steps taken to create an EC2 instance

The steps here are what I chose my instance will use, but they don't necessarily mean this is what your instance should also use.

### Name and Tags

Where you choose the Instance name or add additional tags. 

The name I picked is `Flacial Links Server`

### Application and OS Images

I chose Ubuntu x86 because I'm familiar with it, and it uses fewer resources compared to Windows.

### Instance type

In this section, you choose the instance type or basically what CPU/Memory does the instance use.

The instance varies from 2 vCPU/1 GiB Memory to 96 vCPU/764 GiB Memory.

I picked t3.micro or 2 vCPU/1 GiB Memory because it's eligible to free tier.

### Key pair

Generate an SSH key that'll be used to securely connect to the instance. Once you pick the algorithm and key name, you'll download a file that has the credentials. 

### Network settings

Here you can configure the security group (who can communicate with the instance and who it can communicate with), SSH traffic (connecting to the instance), HTTPs, and HTTP.

I choose to enable HTTPs and HTTP traffic, and only allow my IP to connect to the instance.

### Configure storage

Here we configure the storage the instance can have. We can choose up to 30 GB of storage in the free tier, and this is what I picked.

##### Additional details

Advanced stuff that I didn't touch.

## Connecting to the instance

After creating the instance, this window will show and follow the guide named "Connect to your instance"
