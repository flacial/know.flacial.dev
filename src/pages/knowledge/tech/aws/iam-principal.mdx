## Principals

A principal is an AWS entity that can assume a role and take its permissions to perform some actions in AWS.

It could be:

- AWS account
- IAM role
- IAM user
- Federated SAML users

### Service Principal

The method [`ServicePrincipal`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_iam.ServicePrincipal.html) from the CDK is used to represent the service that can assume the role.

[Remember when we wanted to log the requests made by API Gateway to CloudWatch?](./api-gateway#logging-1) We had to first create a service role that has the permissions to log to CloudWatch and this role can ONLY be assumed by API Gateway service.

![iam service principal diagram](../../../../images/iam-service-principal.png)

The service principal for allowing API Gateway to create log events in CloudWatch has the following policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:GetLogEvents",
        "logs:FilterLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

To do the same thing using CDK:

```ts
import * as iam from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam'
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib'

export class CdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props)

    // Create the role for API Gateway
    const role = new iam.Role(this, 'ApiGatewayRoleFromCDK', {
      // Which entity can use its permissions
      assumedBy: new iam.ServicePrincipal('apigateway.amazonaws.com'),
    })

    // Create the policy for logging in CloudWatch
    const policy = new iam.Policy(
      this,
      'ApiGatewayCloudWatchLogPolicyFromCDK',
      {
        policyName: 'ApiGatewayCloudWatchLogPolicyFromCDK',
        statements: [
          new iam.PolicyStatement({
            actions: [
              'logs:CreateLogGroup',
              'logs:CreateLogStream',
              'logs:DescribeLogGroups',
              'logs:DescribeLogStreams',
              'logs:PutLogEvents',
              'logs:GetLogEvents',
              'logs:FilterLogEvents',
            ],
            resources: ['*'],
          }),
        ],
      }
    )

    // Attach the policy to the role
    role.attachInlinePolicy(policy)
  }
}
```

To confirm the role has the correct principal and policy, we can go to IAM -> Roles -> The new role -> Trust relationships:

![iam trust relationships](../../../../images/iam-trust-relationships.png)

As we can see, it has API Gateway as the service principal.

### More info

When manually creating a role from IAM console, this is how each entity is technically named:
